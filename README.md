# Space Mission Launches Data Analytics Project

##### *by Franco Maldonado*

This is part of Space Mission Launches Data Analytics Data: Cleaning, analysis and visualization
and this workbook has been created to document the entire process of data analysis, cleaning and visualization, and to show the skills and tools to be used. 

## Project background

I Worked with an incredibly rich dataset from nextspaceflight.com that includes all space missions since the beginning of the US-Soviet space race in 1957. 
It contains data on mission status (success/failure), mission cost, number of launches per country and much more. There is much we can learn from this data set about dominant organizations and trends over time.

#### Objectives: 

  1. Which organization launched the most space missions in a given year?
  2. How many launches were performed per year? 
  3. How has the cost of a space mission varied over time?
  4. What months are the most popular for launches? 
  5. Have space missions become safer or have the chances of failure remained unchanged?
